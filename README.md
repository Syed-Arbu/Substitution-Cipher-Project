üîê Substitution Cipher Encryptor & Decryptor

Description:
A robust Python-based tool to encrypt and decrypt messages using a substitution cipher. It supports:
Generating ciphertext from any plaintext using either a fixed or random key.
Decrypting ciphertext accurately using the key.
Frequency analysis enhancements to help decipher unknown texts automatically.
Works for both short messages and longer texts.

Key Features:
Easy-to-use Python script compatible with Google Colab and VS Code.
Random or fixed key encryption for flexible usage.
Shows the exact cipher ‚Üí plain mapping for decryption.
Integrated scoring to improve decryption accuracy.

Use Cases:
Learning cryptography basics and substitution ciphers.
Educational tool for AIML/Computer Science projects.
Testing and practicing frequency analysis attacks on ciphers.

Demo:
Plaintext: am currently studying in hkbk college
Ciphertext: QD EXKKTFZSN LZXRNOFU OF IAWA EGSSTUT
Key: QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM

Technologies Used:
Python 3
Standard libraries: string, random, math, re, collections

How to Run:

Clone this repository.
Open encryptor_decryptor.py in Google Colab or VS Code.
Run the script and input your plaintext to get the ciphertext.

Save the key to decrypt later.
